### The test
All of the files that you will need for the test are located inside of the directory `test-documents`

#### Part 1
* Create a custom post type called `Products`
* A Product needs fields in the admin for Title, Link, Image, Background-color
* Take each of the images from the `product-images` directory, and create a `product` from them.
* Each one should have:
    * a different background-color
    * a different title
    * a link to a page about it
* Display these Products on the home page, and make sure that it looks good in every screen size. You can refer to the screenshot called products, in the `screenshots` directory, to see how it should look.

#### Part 2
* Create a custom post type called `Videos`
* A `video` only needs fields in the admin for Name, youtube-id
* Take each of the videos listed in the text file `videos-list` and create a `video` from them.
* On the home page, below the `products` section, create a new section and that shows only one video and a list of text links for the other videos. Refer to the screenshot called videos, also in the `screenshots` directory to see how it should look.
* When you click the link to another video in the list, the video displaying on the home page should change and become the new video

#### Submitting the Test
* Commit your changes
* Create a git patch
* Export your SQL
* Email the SQL file and patch back
